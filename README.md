# smash, a terminal emulator experiment

All day long I work using a shell under a terminal emulator -- a
combination of software that hasn't changed much in 30 years. Why? I
use the command line because it is powerful and expressive and because
all the other tools I use work well with it. But at the same time it
seems we ought be able to improve on the interface while keeping the
fundamental idea.

Smash is an attempt to improve the textual user interface while
preserving the good parts. Reasonable people can disagree over
what exactly that means. If this whole idea makes you upset please
see the first question in the [FAQ](docs/faq.md).
