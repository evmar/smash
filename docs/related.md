# Related work

The purpose of smash is to explore new ideas in shells/terminals, and many
others have explored these ideas as well. Over the years I've tinkered on smash
I've also tried to collect the work of others as inspiration.

I've attempted to break these into categories, but many of them span categories.

## Integration between shell and UI

- [TermKit](https://acko.net/blog/on-termkit/) is the clearest ancestor of
  smash, attempting to rethink the UI of a terminal
- [A Whole New World](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world)
  is a talk in part about a smarter terminal
- [Upterm, formerly Black Screen](https://github.com/railsware/upterm),
  JS-based, lots of neat-looking ideas
- [notty](https://github.com/withoutboats/notty), just a spec(?) for extended
  terminal escape codes
- http://domterm.org/
- http://extraterm.org/

## Better UI

- [Terminology](https://www.enlightenment.org/about-terminology), X terminal
  emulator with stuff like inline image display
- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/), OSX only, v3 does some clever stuff to
  integrate with the underlying shell
- [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)
- https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty
- https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty
- https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/screen.html
